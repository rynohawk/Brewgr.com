Database Setup
--------------------------
1. Fork and clone the repository on your machine
2. Navigate to the "Setup\Database" folder in the repository root and follow the directions in the  [README](Setup/Database/README.md).

Connection String Setup
----------------------------
1. Determine what your valid connection string is based upon your database setup.  If you need help with the connection string, check out http://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-server/.
2. Create a system Enviornment Variable named "Brewgr_ConnectionString" and set the value to the connection string determined in step 1 above. 
3. You may need to reboot your machine for Visual Studio and IIS Express to recognize the variable.

Host File Entry
----------------------------
The development environment uses an artificial host name dev.brewgr.com.  In order to make this work, you'll need create a host file entry on your development machine that points dev.brewgr.com to 127.0.0.1.

```
127.0.0.1	dev.brewgr.com
```

IIS Express Setup
----------------------------
In order to make IIS Express play nice with the host name, you'll need to modify the applicationhost.config file to look like the following:

```xml
 <site name="dev.brewgr.com" id="1" serverAutoStart="true">
 	<application path="/">
 		<virtualDirectory path="/" physicalPath="{repo root path}\Brewgr.Web" />
 	</application>
 	<bindings>
 		<binding protocol="http" bindingInformation=":80:dev.brewgr.com" />
 	</bindings>
 </site>
```
If you're using Visual Studio 2015, you can modify the applicationhost.config file that gets created in the .vs folder for the Brewgr.Web project, but you'll need to launch the solution once first and dismiss the localhost warning.  At this point the file will be created.  Make the changes and either reload the Brewgr.Web project or restart Visual Studio.

If you're not using Visual Studio 2015, you will need to modify the applicationhost.config that is located in the Documents\IISExpress folder under your account folder.  

Test Your Setup
----------------------------
1. Launch Visual Studio (with elevated access -- necessary for the non-localhost URL)
2. Open the [Brewgr.Web.sln](Brewgr.Web.sln) file.  You'll need to make sure that you have Nuget installed and pull down the dependency packages.  NOTE: Brewgr uses a packages folder that is at the same level as the solution folder, as noted in the Nuget.config file.
3. If you can build the solution sucessfully, you should be good to go.
 
Please let us know if you encounter setup errors and we'll help you out.  Cheers!
